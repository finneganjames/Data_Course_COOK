# Data_Course_COOK
This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments. 

This line is me testing whether or not I can remember how to commit new updates without having to reference the assignment instructions. 

Should I have potentially used git bash instead of going through the whole installation process for WSL? Probably. 

Gonna delete all of this before my 10th commit message so nobody knows how long it took me to figure this out.
